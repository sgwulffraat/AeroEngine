# PYroMat

Thermodynamic tools for Python

By Chris Martin [crm28@psu.edu](mailto:crm28@psu.edu)

PYroMat is a flexible platform for conveniently working with thermodynamic data.  The expanding collection of substances includes data for the properties people need most, exposed in an intuitively designed object interface [Come read more.](http://www.pyromat.org)

## Installation from the Python Package Index
If you have pip installed, you can install PYroMat with a single command.
```
$ pip install pyromat 
```
If you are upgrading, you can always use
```
$ pip install pyromat --upgrade
```

## Getting started
```python
>>> import pyromat as pm
>>> O2 = pm.get('ig.O2')
>>> h = O2.h(492,1.01)  # enthalpy at 492K, 1.01bar
>>> pm.info('O2')     # where did these data come from?
>>> pm.config['unit_pressure'] = 'psi'  # Don't like working in bar?
```

Happy calculating!
